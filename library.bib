  abstract  = "The social cost of methane (SC-CH4) measures the economic loss
               of welfare caused by emitting one tonne of methane into the
               atmosphere. This valuation may in turn be used in cost--benefit
               analyses or to inform climate policies1--3. However, current
               SC-CH4 estimates have not included key scientific findings and
               observational constraints. Here we estimate the SC-CH4 by
               incorporating the recent upward revision of 25 per cent to
               calculations of the radiative forcing of methane4, combined with
               calibrated reduced-form global climate models and an ensemble of
               integrated assessment models (IAMs). Our multi-model mean
               estimate for the SC-CH4 is US\$933 per tonne of CH4 (5--{}95 per
               cent range, US\$471--1,570 per tonne of CH4) under a
               high-emissions scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway
               (RCP) 8.5), a 22 per cent decrease compared to estimates based
               on the climate uncertainty framework used by the US federal
               government5. Our ninety-fifth percentile estimate is 51 per cent
               lower than the corresponding figure from the US framework. Under
               a low-emissions scenario (RCP 2.6), our multi-model mean
               decreases to US\$710 per tonne of CH4. Tightened equilibrium
               climate sensitivity estimates paired with the effect of
               previously neglected relationships between uncertain parameters
               of the climate model lower these estimates. We also show that
               our SC-CH4 estimates are sensitive to model combinations; for
               example, within one IAM, different methane cycle sub-models can
               induce variations of approximately 20 per cent in the estimated
               SC-CH4. But switching IAMs can more than double the estimated
               SC-CH4. Extending our results to account for societal concerns
               about equity produces SC-CH4 estimates that differ by more than
               an order of magnitude between low- and high-income regions. Our
               central equity-weighted estimate for the USA increases to
               US\$8,290 per tonne of CH4 whereas our estimate for sub-Saharan
               Africa decreases to US\$134 per tonne of CH4. Accounting for
               equity influences the social cost of methane more than climate
               model uncertainty does and produces results that differ by over
               an order of magnitude between low- and high-income regions.",

Population data used in these studies are typically aggregated at census enumeration units, which are too coarse for many applications. Accurate population downscaling methods are needed to obtain population data at finer spatial resolutions. We use a novel settlement-related database, Built-Up Property Records (BUPR) from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the United States (HISDAC-US) to downscale population from census tracts to block groups. The BUPR dataset provides the number of built-up property records for each 250-m grid at 5-year temporal resolution from 1810 to 2015 for most contiguous United States (CONUS). The ability of BUPR to downscale population from census tracts to block groups for four states, representing a range of population densities, is evaluated here by comparing against other commonly-used ancillary datasets. The BUPR-based method outperforms all other methods in all but one state with highly-incomplete BUPR. A more detailed accuracy assessment is performed by dividing each state into low, medium, and high population density categories. The BUPR method produces more accurate downscaled population estimates for low and medium categories, though its performance deteriorates in the high density category due to its relatively coarse spatial resolution. BUPR-based dasymetric mapping is subsequently applied to the CONUS and found to generalize well beyond the four comparison states with high downscaling accuracy. The long-term record of the HISDAC-US dataset enables the potential construction of fine-grained population data back to 1810.},

  abstract = "Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used to analyze coupled
              natural and human systems. Descriptive models require careful
              calibration with observed data. However, ABMs are often not
              calibrated in a formal sense. Here we examine the impact of data
              record size and aggregation on the calibration of an ABM for
              housing abandonment in the presence of flood risk. Using a
              perfect model experiment, we examine (i) model calibration and
              (ii) the ability to distinguish a model with inter-agent
              interactions from one without. We show how limited data sets may
              not adequately constrain a model with just four parameters and
              relatively minimal interactions. We also illustrate how limited
              data can be insufficient to identify the correct model structure.
              As a result, many ABM-based inferences and projections rely
              strongly on prior distributions. This emphasizes the need for

              journal to which they will submit the study. This decision
              requires to navigate trade-offs between multiple objectives. One
              objective is to share the new knowledge as widely as possible.
              Citation counts can serve as a proxy to quantify this objective.
              A second objective is to minimize the time commitment put into
              sharing the research, which may be estimated by the total time
              from initial submission to final decision. A third objective is
              to minimize the number of rejections and resubmissions. Thus,
              researchers often consider the trade-offs between the objectives
              of (i) maximizing citations, (ii) minimizing time-to-decision,
              and (iii) minimizing the number of resubmissions. To complicate
              matters further, this is a decision with multiple, potentially
              conflicting, decision-maker rationalities. Co-authors might have
              different preferences, for example about publishing fast versus
              maximizing citations. These diverging preferences can lead to
              conflicting trade-offs between objectives. Here, we apply a
              multi-objective decision analytical framework to identify the
              Pareto-front between these objectives and determine the set of
              journal submission pathways that balance these objectives for
              three stages of a researcher's career. We find multiple
              strategies that researchers might pursue, depending on how they
              value minimizing risk and effort relative to maximizing
              citations. The sequences that maximize expected citations within
              each strategy are generally similar, regardless of time horizon.
              We find that the ``conditional impact factor''-impact factor
              times acceptance rate-is a suitable heuristic method for ranking
              journals, to strike a balance between minimizing effort
              objectives and maximizing citation count. Finally, we examine
              potential co-author tension resulting from differing
              rationalities by mapping out each researcher's preferred Pareto
              front and identifying compromise submission strategies. The
              explicit representation of trade-offs, especially when multiple
              decision-makers (co-authors) have different preferences,
              facilitates negotiations and can support the decision process.",

              infrastructure models. Previous studies have broken important new
              ground on the considerable tensions between the costs of
              upgrading infrastructure and the damages that could result from
              extreme flood events. However, many risk-based adaptation
              strategies remain silent on certain potentially important
              uncertainties, as well as the tradeoffs between competing
              objectives. Here, we implement and improve on a classic
              decision-analytical model (Van Dantzig 1956) to: (i) capture
              tradeoffs across conflicting stakeholder objectives, (ii)
              demonstrate the consequences of structural uncertainties in the

              from a single-objective problem formulation to one with
              multiobjective tradeoffs dramatically expands the decision space,
              and highlights the need for compromise solutions to address
              stakeholder preferences. We find deep structural uncertainties
              that have large effects on the model outcome, with the storm
              surge parameters accounting for the greatest impacts. Global
              sensitivity analysis effectively identifies important parameter

  important to inform the design of risk‐management strategies. Assessing such
  strategies necessarily brings values into research. But the values assumed
  within research (often only implicitly) may not align with those of
  stakeholders and decision makers. These misalignments are often invisible to
  researchers and can severely limit research relevance or lead to inappropriate
  policy advice. Aligning strategy assessments with stakeholders' values
  requires a holistic approach to research design that is oriented around those
  values from the start. Integrating values into research in this way requires
  collaboration with stakeholders, integration across disciplines, and attention
  to all aspects of research design. Here we describe and demonstrate a
  qualitative conceptual tool called a values‐informed mental model (ViMM) to
  support such values‐centered research design. ViMMs map stakeholders' values
  onto a conceptual model of a study system to visualize the intersection of
  those values with coupled natural‐human system dynamics. Through this mapping,
  ViMMs integrate inputs from diverse collaborators to support the design of
  research that assesses risk‐management strategies in light of stakeholders'
  values. We define a visual language for ViMMs, describe accompanying practices
  and workflows, and present an illustrative application to the case of
  flood‐risk management in a small community along the Susquehanna river in the
  Northeast United States.},

              flood hazards. However, ABM simulation results can be highly

Global sensitivity analyses can provide insights on how uncertain inputs and interactions influence the outputs. Many sensitivity analysis methods face nontrivial challenges for computationally demanding models. Common approaches to tackle these challenges are to (i) use a computationally efficient emulator and (ii) sample adaptively. However, these approaches still involve potentially large computational costs and approximation errors. Here we compare the results and computational costs of four existing global sensitivity analysis methods applied to a test problem. We sample different model evaluation time and numbers of model parameters. We find that the emulation and adaptive sampling approaches are faster than Sobol' method for slow models. The Bayesian adaptive spline surface method is the fastest for most slow and high-dimensional models. Our results can guide the choice of a sensitivity analysis method under computational resources constraints.},

              tradeoffs when developing a management plan. Complex interactions

              challenging, especially when decisions play out under the deep
              and dynamic uncertainties associated with climate change. Here we
              explored a suite of management strategies to maximize multiple
              management objectives and minimize tradeoffs under future climate
              projections and quantified the greatest sources of uncertainty.
              We used a spatially-explicit forest simulation model (LANDIS-II)
              to simulate the effects of wind, management, and climate change
              in central Wisconsin and calculated benefits and tradeoffs among
              six management objectives (maximize aboveground carbon (C), soil
              C, harvested C, C stored in species of cultural importance to the
              Menominee tribe, tree diversity, and age diversity). We found
              that uneven-aged management achieves more ecosystem benefits
              (except for harvested C) than the other harvest strategies, but
              it was the business-as-usual harvest scenario that minimized
              tradeoffs among objectives. Climate change made it more difficult
              to store C in soils and have diverse forests and the management
              strategies we considered were unable to regain these lost
              benefits. Climate change reduced harvested C and C stored in
              culturally-important species, but the management strategies were
              able to at least partially compensate for this effect. The
              uncertainty surrounding the climate projections generated the
              largest variation in all benefits except harvested C. Managers
              seeking to maximize benefits and minimize tradeoffs should
              consider a range of silvicultural strategies while recognizing
              that climate change may shrink the operating space for achieving
              foresters' management goals.",
